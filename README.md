## Introduction

This repository contains a variety of scripts built for Google Earth Engine, with applications to agriculture and environmental science. Whether you're working on crop monitoring, deforestation analysis, land cover change detection, or other related topics, these scripts aim to provide an easy starting point for your research.

## Repository Structure

- **/scripts**: This directory contains the individual GEE scripts for different agricultural and environmental science applications.
- **/docs**: Documentation for using specific scripts, explaining the datasets, methodologies, and example outputs.
- **/examples**: Sample outputs and visualization results from the scripts.

## Getting Started

To get started with the scripts in this repository, you will need to have a Google Earth Engine (GEE) account. If you don‚Äôt have one, you can sign up [here](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/).

### Prerequisites:
- Google Earth Engine account
- Basic understanding of JavaScript (for GEE code editor)
- Familiarity with remote sensing datasets (e.g., MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel)

## Scripts Overview

The scripts in this repository are organized by the following categories:

### Agriculture:
- **Crop Classification**: Scripts for detecting and classifying crops based on satellite imagery.
- **Vegetation Index Calculation**: Scripts to calculate NDVI, EVI, and other vegetation indices to monitor crop health.
- **Crop Yield Estimation**: Using remote sensing data to estimate crop yield potential and productivity.

### Environmental Science:
- **Deforestation Monitoring**: Scripts for monitoring deforestation and land cover change over time.
- **Land Surface Temperature Analysis**: Using thermal infrared data to study temperature patterns and their effects on ecosystems.
- **Water Body Detection**: Identifying and tracking water bodies using multi-spectral satellite imagery.

## How to Use

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine or GitHub account using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gee-agriculture-environment.git
   ```

2. **Access Google Earth Engine**: 
   - Go to the [Google Earth Engine Code Editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com/).
   - Open a new script and copy/paste the contents of the specific script file from the repository into the editor.
   
3. **Run the Script**:
   - Modify the parameters and regions of interest as needed.
   - Click on the "Run" button in the GEE code editor to execute the script.

4. **Visualize Results**: After running the script, you can visualize the results in the map window and export data for further analysis.

5. **Documentation**: Refer to the `/docs` folder for additional documentation on each script and its functionality.
